Here we have a clone of the directory containing watch-varnish.pl.  I am 
trying to extract the watch-varnish.pl program along with it's history.  I will
then move the repo up to gitHub.


Here's the command I use to clone off a working repo.
       git clone --no-hardlinks /home/lee/FIRST/prodGitControlled/bil1Svn01 ./bil1Svn01Clone; cd bil1Svn01Clone/;git remote rm origin
