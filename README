ABOUT
=====

This is a program somewhat similar to varniststat except that it will
monitor a set of varnish servers instead of just a single server.  A
companion program, webnoded.pl, must be installed on each of the
varnish servers and run by xinetd.  When you telniet in to port 7600,
the webnoded.pl program responds to commands to dump varnish stats.
